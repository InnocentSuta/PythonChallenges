''' The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, 
    starting with 0, and 1. The Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55â€¦
    Written as a rule, the expression is: Xn = X(n-1) + X(n-2)
    
    This program finds the nth term in the fibonacci sequence.
